The Haar cascades in this directory can be used in place of HCSB.txt (which,
by the way, is identical to frontalfacealt.txt) in the 
directory above this one to detect other features. These Haar cascades are
converted from the Haar cascades supplied with the OpenCV, a C++-based
open source library for image processing and computer vision. The OpenCV
is at http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/. The OpenCV
contains more information about these cascades and can be used to create
a custom cascade for recognizing any feature. The resulting cascade can be
converted (so long as it is stump-based) to the format of these files using
the haar2j2me program supplied with JJIL.

The license for the original files, which applies to these translated files,
is below. The copyright for the files varies. Frontalfacealt2,
frontalfacealt, frontalfacedefault and profileface are are (c) 2000, 
Intel Corporation. Fullbody, lowerbody, and upperbody are (c) 2004, Hannes 
Kruppa and Bernt Schiele (ETH Zurich, Switzerland). In both cases all
