  We use application Hungarian notation, with these abbreviations:
      <ul>
          <li>b -- a computed value (type byte)</li>
          <li>c -- a count of items (type int)</li>
          <li>d -- an offset into an array or Vector (type int)</li>
          <li>i -- any other type of index (type int).</li>
          <li>o -- a flag -- true or false (type boolean)</li>
          <li>rg -- an array (type in following prefix). We collapse two or more
            'rg' sequences into a single 'rgx'.</li>
          <li>sz -- a string (type String).</li>
          <li>v -- a vector (type Vector).</li>
          <li>w -- a computed value (int)</li>
      </ul>
  In addition the variable names i, j, k, etc. are used for indices.
  <p>
      All fields should be referenced by being preceded with 'this.'. We don't
      use a special prefix like _ or m before field names. Contant fields are
      are not preceded by 'this.' and also do not have a Hungarian notation
      prefix. They begin with a capital letter.
  </p>
  <p>
      Methods are named following the usual Java conventions. Classes each
      specify their Hungarian prefix in their header comments.
  </p>
  <p>
      Whenever there are several items of a similar purpose (methods,
      fields, constants, etc.) they are listed in alphabetical order.
